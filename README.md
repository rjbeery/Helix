Helix AI — Project Overview

Purpose
Helix AI is a demonstration platform built by Rhoderick J. Beery to showcase advanced proficiency in software engineering, systems and infrastructure design, AWS cloud architecture, and applied artificial intelligence. The project unifies these disciplines into a cohesive, production-grade application hosted publicly on GitHub, serving both as a professional portfolio and a technically meaningful product.

Beyond being a showcase, Helix AI has a functional purpose: it enables multi-agent collaboration among large language models (LLMs). Each agent is configured with a distinct persona, defined by an avatar, prompt specialization, and behavioral parameters. Users can submit questions in two modes.

Parallel Mode: The query is sent simultaneously to multiple agents, and their independent responses are displayed side by side for comparison.
Sequential Mode: The query is passed to the first agent, and its response is then reviewed by subsequent agents. Each reviewer agent must either approve the previous answer or improve it if it can contribute a substantial enhancement.

This architecture allows Helix AI to explore the concept of a meta-AI consensus — aggregating multiple models to refine accuracy, reasoning depth, and creative output.

Infrastructure Overview
Helix AI is a full-stack, serverless web application built entirely on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It combines a React and TypeScript frontend with a Python FastAPI backend, designed for scalability, security, and cost efficiency.

Frontend
The frontend is built with Vite for rapid bundling and deployment. It is hosted as a static site on Amazon S3 and served globally through Amazon CloudFront, with HTTPS provided by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). DNS management is handled by Amazon Route 53, ensuring low-latency, authoritative routing for both the main domain and the API subdomain.

Backend
The backend is implemented as a containerized FastAPI service running on AWS Lambda, fronted by Amazon API Gateway for HTTP routing, CORS, and domain management. Docker images are versioned and stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for reproducible builds and rollbacks. Secrets such as JWT keys, authentication hashes, and API credentials are managed securely through AWS Secrets Manager, with strict IAM role-based access control. The system is event-driven and auto-scaling, ensuring high availability with zero idle compute cost.

Operations and Deployment
All infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform, providing reproducible, version-controlled environments. CI/CD pipelines, built with either GitHub Actions or AWS CodeBuild, automate builds, deployments, and CloudFront cache invalidations. Observability and diagnostics are handled by Amazon CloudWatch, which aggregates logs, metrics, and error traces. All data is encrypted at rest using AWS KMS and in transit via TLS 1.2+.
